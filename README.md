The methodology used to create the seat finder application in Flutter involves the following steps:

1. **Project Setup**: First, we set up a new Flutter project using the `flutter create` command. This creates a basic Flutter project structure with necessary files and directories.

2. **Dependencies**: We add the required dependencies to the `pubspec.yaml` file. In this case, we only need the `cupertino_icons` package for the app's icon.

3. **UI Design**: We design the user interface of the app using Flutter widgets. The main screen contains a text field for entering the seat number, a button for finding the berth type, and a seat map represented by a grid view.

4. **Business Logic**: We implement the logic to determine the berth type based on the given seat number. The `getBerthType` function uses simple mathematical calculations to figure out the berth type.

5. **State Management**: To handle state changes, we use the `setState` method and a `selectedSeatNumber` variable to track the currently selected seat.

6. **Event Handling**: We use the `GestureDetector` to capture tap events on the seats in the seat map. When the user taps a seat, it updates the `selectedSeatNumber` and the text in the input field.

7. **Dialogs**: To show information about the selected seat, we use `showDialog` to display an alert dialog with the berth type when the "Find Berth" button is pressed.

To run the code and see the seat finder application in action, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Flutter**: Make sure you have Flutter installed on your system.

2. **Create a new Flutter project**: Create a new Flutter project using the `flutter create` command in your terminal or command prompt:

3. **Replace Code**: Replace the content of `lib/main.dart` in the newly created project with the code .

4. **Run the App**: Now, you can run the app on your preferred emulator or physical device using the `flutter run` command:

This command will build the app and launch it on the connected emulator or device. You should see the seat finder application with a text field to enter the seat number, a button to find the berth type, and a seat map below it. You can tap on any seat in the seat map, and the app will highlight the selected seat with a green background color. When you enter a seat number in the text field and press the "Find Berth" button, the app will show an alert dialog with the berth type corresponding to the entered seat number.

Now you have a fully functional single-screen seat finder application that assists users in identifying the location and type of berth based on the given seat number, along with a visual representation of the seat map.
